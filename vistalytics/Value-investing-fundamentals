value investing fundamentals:
> Price to earnings (P/E) ratio
	Market price of share / Earnings per share
	trailing P/E: last 4 quaters EPS gives P/E
	forward P/E: EPS forecasting for next 4 quarters 

> Earnings per share (EPS)
	          Net income - preffered dividends
	-------------------------------------------------
			  Outstanding Shares

> PEG (Price to Earnings to Growth)
	=< 1
	Used to determine stock is cheap or expensive
	>1 Stock is expensive
	=< Stock price is reasonable or cheap 
	Dont provide information about dividends paid
	P/E ratio
      -----------------------------
	Extimated EPS growth rate

> Retained earnings
	% OF NET profit that company invests for expansion

> Dividend
	Amount from profit paid to share holders

> Dividend yield
	Financial ratio: % of dividend paid to share price
	Company is financialy healthy then it pays stable dividend to share holders.

> Price to Earnings to Growth and Yield (Dividend Yield) (PEGY) 
		P/E ratio
	------------------------
	EPS growth rate + Yield
	
	=< 1
	High dividend yields should be ignored.

High retained earnings
			    } High growth. Share price will go up.
Low or no dividends yields

Low retained earnings
			} Low groth. More debt for expansion.
High dividends yield

> Stock Intrensic value
Stock undervalued: intrensic value > current share price (Cheap to buy)
Stock overvalued: intrensic value < current share price (Expensive to buy)

> Market Capitalization
	Market cap = current share price * outstanding shares
	

> Margin of safety(%)
		Current share price
	1 -  ------------------------
		Intrensic Value

	at least 25%
	e.g.: While investing in stock
	current share price: 18
	margin of safety: 40%
	intrensic value: 35
	
	1st Observation:
	intrensic value > current share price => (Undervalued) Good to buy
	
	2nd Observation:
	Margin of safety factor = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60
	Adjusted value = intrensic value * Margin of safety factor
	
	Adjusted value > current share price : Good to buy
	Adjusted value = current share price : hold
	Adjusted value < current share price : sell

	

> Value investment strategies: To pick high potential stocks
	Value investment Process:
		1. Fundamental analysis: Helps to find strong companies

		2. Technical analysis: Gets you in market at right time.

	>> Stock screening process:
		criterias to eleminate less liquid companies and not fundamentally strong
		Find companies with good performance over last 3 or max years.
		Finviz.com
		Zacks.com

		criteria
			1. Mid or higher cap
			2. Positive dividends
			3. Average share volume (over 500k)
			4. Positive EPS growth for last 3-5 years
			5. Postive EPS growth for this year
			6. Positive EPS growth for next 3-5 years
			7. Postive sales growth for last 3-5 yers 
			8. Positive return on equity (>= 10%)
			9. Positve return on Investment
			10. Positve Gross margin
			11. Positve Operating margin
			12. Positive profit margin
			13. Positive inside transaction
			14. Market sector (Rotation strategies)
				e.g. Market is goinmg up look for week stocks.
				Market grtting down look for defensive stocks

	>> Set criteria
		Financial performance (Income and cash flow statement)
		
		1. Profitability Statement
			Analysis income statement and cash-flow-statement
			Analysis revenue, net income, eps, return on equity, cash flow from operation
			
		2. Financial health statement
			Debt settlement capacity
			3 * free cash flow = long-term debts
			current ration > 1.5

	>> Stock valuation
		use PEGY ratio to determine overvalued and undervalued stocks
		undervalued stock are open to buy
		overvalued stock are added in watch list
		Intrensic value = Real Value
			If Market value (Actual selling price) = intrensic value (Fair price)
			If Market value < intrensic value (undervalued)
			If market value > intrensic value (overvalued)
		Calculate intrensic value
			1. Find Financial figures
			2. Find discount rate (WACC Weighted average cost of capital)
				Used to predict present value of stock
				capital from equity investors and debts (banks or financial institutions)
				
				^MV Equity  * RE   +   ^MV of Debt *  RD
			      --------------------------------------
				     (^MV Equity + ^MV of Debt)

			MV = Market Value
			RE = Cost of equity = ^Risk Free Rate + ^Stock Beta * ^Market Risk Premium    (Calculated using Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM))
			RD = Cost of debt  = ^Intrest rate * ( 1 - Tax Rate)

			3. Find Discounted free cash flow (Project for next 10 years)
				

			4. Present value 10 year free cash flow.
			5. Find intrensic value

							  Present Value + Terminal value + Cash -Debt
			   intrensic value per share =  ----------------------------------------------
						              ^Total outstanding shares

			   Cash = Cash and Cash equivalent
			   Debt = Total liabilites
			   ^Current share price 
			   ^shares outstanding
			   ^free cash flow
			   ^long-term growth rate
			   Discount Rate (WACC)
			   
			6. Compare intrensic value with market value

> Return on equity (ROE)


> Margin of safety (MOS)
	Intrensic value per share * MOS factor


> Buy high sell higher
	Use Simple Moving Averages 

> Rolling mean / Moving Averages
	Unweighted mean of last n values

> Weighted Moving Average
	Gives priority to recent prices than on older prices
	WMA = ( Price * n + Price(1) * n-1 + ... Price( n-1 ) * 1) / ( n * ( n + 1 ) / 2 )

	Where: n = time period
