		> Database is a physical container for collections. Each database gets its own set of files on the file system. A single MongoDB server typically has multiple databases.
		> Collection is a group of MongoDB documents. It is the equivalent of an RDBMS table. A collection exists within a single database. Collections do not enforce a schema. Documents within a collection can have different fields. Typically, all documents in a collection are of similar or related purpose.
