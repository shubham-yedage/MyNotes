>> SPARQL: SPA : Protocol with set of rules that exchange query from client side to server side.
	   RQL : RDF Query Language

>> RDF: Resource Data Framework
	Data interchange model for web

>> SPARQL with some available interfaces can work with differ types of data formats (like xml, json, spreadsheets etc.)

>> RDF is data model whic expresses facts (three-part statements). These facts or triples are "subject, predicate, object"
	e.g.:
	Subject		Predict		Object

>> "Subject, predicate and object" can be also called as "resource, property name and property value"

>> Triples sentence usually end with 'period (.)'. In SPARQL comments starts with '#' usually.

>> ".ttl" files are Turtle RDF format files.

>> ARQ: Query engine for Jena supports SPARQL RDF Query language.
	Java based program from Apache Jena framework.

>> Data can be imported within query by "FROM <<dataset_name.ttl>>" or by protocol "arq --data <data_set.ttl>"
	Data set name by protocol will ralways have high priority.

>> Multiple triples in curly braces forms graph patterns. 
	Tree data structure without the hierarchyâ€”any node can connect to any other one
	Nodes represent subject or object resources, and the predicates are the connections between nodes.

>> Browser query interface: http://dbpedia.org/snorql/
	Source: DBpedia (collection of data from the gray infoboxes of fielded data that you often see on the right side of Wikipedia pages)

>> Ontology on DBPedia: http://dbpedia.org/ontology/


>> Run query file:
	arq --data <data.ttl> --query <query.rq>
