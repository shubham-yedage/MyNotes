writing code:
1. Client-server architecture
2. No logic in class containing client related data
3. logic remains at server side only
4. no calls must be made from class related to server to the class related to client
5. only client to server calls
6. try to make variables scope limited to block only. initialise and use
7. use raw data types for declarations
8. no warnings and unnecessary imports 
9. try to use class for objects having attributes. use getter, setter, hash code, equals, compareto and compare methods as per necessary

----junit----

10.one class one test class
11.public method with some concrete logic can have one test method
12.only apply it to that methods attributes
